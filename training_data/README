IMPORTANT! TO DECRYPT THE DATA:

1. be on a POSIX-compliant system with standard userland tools
2. have GPG installed
3. set envvar BPPASS to the last name (in standard mixed spelling but
   BACKWARDS) of the famous female researcher who did groundbreaking
   early research on radioactivity, discovered a few radioactive
   elements, and received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. As
   an example: for one of her famous colleagues, it would be in Bash
   export BPPASS="lereuqceB"
4. go to the training_data directory and run ./decrypt.sh

=======================================================================


This is the texrex-neuedimensionen (and later) boilerplate detection
training data. Each language folder contains the following folders:


annotated/

One training document per file, split into blocks by
texrex-neuedimensionen. Each block is preceded by either:

0<TAB>	= Block is NOT boilerplate according to rater.
1<TAB>	= Block IS boilerplate according to rater.


csv/

The metrics generated by texrex-neuedimensionen for the blocks. Each
file corresponds line-by-line to the ones in annotated/.


html/

The original HTML files with ARC crawling header. Additional files
(CSS, JS, etc.) are not available.


txt/

The input as given to the raters. Same format as in annotated/, each
line preceded with a default "1" decision (= is boilerplate).


xml/

The texrex-neuedimensionen output for the pages in html/. It was used
to extract the files in csv/ and txt/.
